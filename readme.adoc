Writings by and about Dyer D. Lum::
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyer_Lum[Dyer Lum] was a 19-century American anarchist. In the 1870's he traveled around the country, including to Utah, as part of a congressional committee appointed to "`inquire into the depression of labor.`"
    * John S. McCormick's http://atom.lib.byu.edu/smh/6514/["`An Anarchist Defends the Mormons: The Case of Dyer D. Lum`"] (_Utah Historical Quarterly_ 44, 1976: 156-69) is an excellent summary of Lum's analysis of the social and legal conflict between the Mormons and the United States. McCormick also quotes other 19th-century anarchists on the Mormon issue, including Benjamin Tucker. (https://web.archive.org/web/20160821023506/http://digitallibrary.utah.gov/awweb/awarchive?type=file&item=34919[Direct link to the archived PDF].)
    * https://books.google.com/books?id=gVI2AQAAMAAJ[_Utah and Its People: Facts and Statistics Bearing on the "Mormon Problem"_] (R.O. Ferrier & Company, 1882) is a booklet in which Lum defends Mormonism while praising its democratic society and cooperative economy.
    * https://archive.org/details/socialproblemsof00lumd[_Social problems of today: or, the Mormon question in its economic aspects_] is an updated and much expanded version of _Utah and Its people_ in which Lum continues to defend the Mormons against increased state repression. "`The whole Mormon system, social, religious, industrial, is essentially based on two fundamental principles: _cooperation_ in business and _arbitration_ in disputes.`" Lum contrasts those Mormon values with the mainstream American values of capitalism and civil litigation.
    * In https://web.archive.org/web/http://wiki.libertarian-labyrinth.org/index.php?title=Mormon_and_Caesar["`Mormon and Caesar`"] (_Liberty_, April 17, 1886, #79), Lum argues that the motivational force behind the Edmunds Anti-Polygamy was to crush the cooperative economy set up by Mormons in Utah. (This article is something of a highly compressed version of the first chapter of _The Social Problems of Today_.)
    * In http://wiki.libertarian-labyrinth.org/index.php?title=Mormon_Co-operation["`Mormon Co-operation,`"] (_Liberty_, July 3, 1886, #83), Lum responds to a sceptic about Mormon democracy and cooperation.
    * My own link:/log/2015/1/20/dyer_lum_on_the_civil_and_mormon_wars/["`Dyer Lum on the Civil and Mormon Wars`"] presents an overly simplified theory of the relationship between slavery, Mormon cooperatives, and capitalism with application to some interesting events in American history
